# TCP
- Stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
- It's a layer 4 Protocol (Layer 4 protocols operate at the **transport layer** of the OSI model).
- Ability to address processes in a host using **ports**.
- **Controls** the transmission unlike **UDP** which is a firehose.
- Requires handshake.
- **20** bytes headers segment (can go to 60).
- Stateful.

## TCP Use Cases.
- 🏹 Reliable communication.
- 🏹 Remote shell.
- 🏹 Database connections.
- 🏹 Web communications.
- 🏹 Any bidirectional communication.

## What Is TCP Connection?
A TCP connection refers to a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel established between two endpoints using the **Transmission Control Protocol** at the transport layer. 
It ensures data is delivered in order, without errors or loss, through mechanisms like **handshakes** and **acknowledgments**. 
A connection is identified by 4 properties.
- SourceIP-SourcePort.
- DestinationIP-DestinationPort.



Note:
How TCP is Different from WebSockets.
